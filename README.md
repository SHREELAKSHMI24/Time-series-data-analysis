INTRODUCTION TO TIME SERIES DATA SET:
A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. ... Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.

INTRODUCTION TO ARIMA MODEL:
ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models. Univariate (single vector) ARIMA is a forecasting technique that projects the future values of a series based entirely on its own inertia. Its main application is in the area of short term forecasting requiring at least 40 historical data points. It works best when your data exhibits a stable or consistent pattern over time with a minimum amount of outliers.
